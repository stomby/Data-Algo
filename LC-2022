Here's a breakdown of the slicing part using numbers as examples:

def construct2DArray(original, m, n):
    if m * n != len(original):
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        result.append(original[i*n : (i+1)*n])
    return result
Let's assume:

original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
m = 2 (rows)
n = 3 (columns)
Step 1: Check if it's possible

m * n (2 * 3) equals 6, which matches the length of original. So, we can proceed.
Step 2: Create the 2D array

We create an empty list called result to store the 2D array.
Step 3: Loop through rows

We loop m (2) times, once for each row.
Step 4: Slice for each row

First iteration (i = 0):

i*n is 0 * 3, which is 0.
(i+1)*n is (0+1) * 3, which is 3.
We take the slice original[0:3], which gives us [1, 2, 3].
We append this slice as the first row of result.
Second iteration (i = 1):

i*n is 1 * 3, which is 3.
(i+1)*n is (1+1) * 3, which is 6.
We take the slice original[3:6], which gives us [4, 5, 6].
We append this slice as the second row of result.
Step 5: Result

result now contains [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], which is our 2D array.
Explanation of the slicing:

i*n calculates the starting index of the slice for each row.
(i+1)*n calculates the ending index of the slice (exclusive) for each row.
By changing i in each iteration, we move the slice window to capture the next n elements from original.
In simpler words:

The slicing takes chunks of n elements from the original list and puts each chunk into a new row of the 2D array.
Edge Case Handling:

The code checks if m * n is not equal to the length of original. If it's not, it means we cannot perfectly fit the elements into the desired 2D shape, so it returns an empty list ([]).
I hope this explanation makes the slicing part clearer! Let me know if you have any other questions.
